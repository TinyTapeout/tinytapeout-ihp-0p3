## How it works

Nominally, a 555 timer using only NPN devices. The comparators and flip flops have been modified a bit from the original 555.

## How to test

TBD. Ideally, there will be one full 555 with analog pins, and one internal 555 that drives a counter.

## External hardware

Standard 555 supporting components.
